            <li><div><span className='font-mont fw-bold'>Valid Days of Exchange :</span><span>Any article purchased online can be exchanged from our stores as well as online within 30 days, once the article has been delivered, given that the customer has proof of purchase. For customers who opt for online exchange process, with a valid reason for exchange, won’t have to pay courier charges for exchange pickup.</span></div></li>
            <li><div><span className='font-mont fw-bold'>Proof of Purchase :</span><span>This includes either a receipt or the online order confirmation email.</span></div></li>
            <li><div><span className='font-mont fw-bold'>Conditions Qualified for Exchange :</span><span> Articles are qualified for change only if they are unused, all tags are intact, packing is in its original condition and original invoice is present. Also, state a valid reason for requesting an exchange, such as if the article is defected, in wrong size, or incorrect. In case of home article exchange, it should be in Sapphire’s original home packing. Similarly, with articles that are delivered in boxes such as the Unstitched Women’s collection, Menswear and semi-formal pieces that are delivered in garment bags must be returned with their original packaging.</span></div></li>
            <li><div><span className='font-mont fw-bold'>Process of Online Exchange :</span><span> It usually takes 7-10 days to complete the online exchange process after it has been verified. Instore exchanges require customers to have the original invoice and all the tags intact for the purchased article. If customers are dissatisfied with the item or have ordered and received the size that won’t fit them then they would be asked to drop off the purchased item at a given location. However, if the item is defected or incorrect then the article will be picked up from the customer’s doorstep.</span></div></li>
